# The-Last-Werewolf
Ludum Dare 35 GameJam entry

In this game you control a Werewolf trying to survive until morning.

The AI depending on whether it's the police or a civilian will try to kill you or run from you accordingly.
This was one of my first attempts creating a custom AI system and although there are one or two bugs it works pretty well
